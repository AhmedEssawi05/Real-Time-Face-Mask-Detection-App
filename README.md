Real-Time Face Mask Detection

**Technologies Used** Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Python, Jupiter Notebook

**Description** Utilizes Python and libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to engineer an algorithm which is trained upon a large data set 
and recieves camera input and in turn determines if all in the frame are wearing masks.

**Purpose** Created during my time interning at SLB, utilized in real-time to detect if employees & visitors of the building were wearing face-masks
as per the policy at the time
